# Paper Discussion Template

Anthropic interviews often include discussing a research paper. Use this template to prepare.

## How Paper Discussions Work

1. You may be given a paper in advance (hours or days)
2. Or asked to discuss a paper you've read
3. You'll be asked to explain, critique, and extend

## What They're Looking For

- **Comprehension**: Do you understand the paper?
- **Critical thinking**: Can you identify strengths/weaknesses?
- **Connections**: Can you relate it to other work?
- **Extension**: Can you propose next steps?
- **Communication**: Can you explain clearly?

## Example Discussion: Constitutional AI

### 1. Basics
- **Title**: Constitutional AI: Harmlessness from AI Feedback
- **Authors**: Bai et al. (Anthropic)
- **Year**: 2022

### 2. One-Sentence Summary
Train harmless AI assistants using AI-generated feedback based on a set of principles, reducing reliance on human labels.

### 3. Problem Statement
- Human feedback is expensive and hard to scale
- Need consistent, scalable oversight
- Want to train helpful AND harmless models

### 4. Key Contribution

- RL-CAI: RLAIF with AI-generated preferences

### 5. Strengths
- Scalable (less human labeling)
- Explicit principles (interpretable)
- Strong harmlessness results

### 6. Weaknesses
- Constitution design is manual
- AI feedback could be biased
- Doesn't solve fundamental alignment

### 7. Extensions
- Collective Constitutional AI (done)
- Learning the constitution
- Multi-objective constitutions

## Practice Tips

1. **Time yourself**: Aim for 5-minute summaries
2. **Practice aloud**: Interview is verbal
3. **Be honest**: Say when you don't know
4. **Have opinions**: They want to see you think
5. **Connect to Anthropic**: Why does this matter for their mission?

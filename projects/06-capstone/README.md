# Project 6: Capstone Project

**Phase:** 5 - Mastery & Portfolio
**Estimated Time:** 30-50 hours
**Difficulty:** Variable (you choose)
**XP on Completion:** +1000 XP

## Overview

This is your major portfolio piece. Choose a substantial project that demonstrates your skills and interests. This should be something you're proud to show in technical discussions.

## Why This Project Matters

- **Portfolio centerpiece**: This is what you'll talk about most
- **Differentiation**: Show what makes you unique
- **Independence**: Demonstrate you can drive projects
- **Passion**: Work on something you genuinely care about

## Project Options

### Option A: Paper Replication
Replicate a key finding from an important paper:
- Choose a paper with reproducible results
- Implement from scratch (not using author's code)
- Reproduce main finding
- Extend or analyze further

**Good candidates:**
- A Constitutional AI experiment
- An interpretability finding
- A scaling law verification
- A prompting technique comparison

### Option B: Open Source Contribution
Make a significant contribution to an LLM project:
- Identify an open issue or feature need
- Implement and submit PR
- Get it merged
- Document your contribution

**Good targets:**
- vLLM
- TransformerLens
- TRL
- LangChain
- Any Anthropic open source

### Option C: Novel Research
Conduct original research:
- Identify an open question
- Design experiments
- Run analysis
- Write up findings

**Requirements:**
- Clear research question
- Solid methodology
- Meaningful results (even negative)
- Research-quality write-up

### Option D: Build Something Useful
Create a tool or application:
- Identify a real need
- Build a working solution
- Deploy and get users
- Gather feedback

**Ideas:**
- Specialized agent for a domain
- Fine-tuned model for a task
- Eval framework for a capability
- Tool for AI safety research

## Requirements

Regardless of option:
- **Substantial**: 30+ hours of work
- **Technical**: Demonstrates ML/LLM skills
- **Documented**: Clear write-up
- **Shareable**: On GitHub with good README
- **Presentable**: Can explain in 10 minutes

| **Total** | **100** |

## Deliverables

1. **Code**: Complete project on GitHub
2. **README**: Clear documentation
3. **Report**: 2000-4000 word write-up
4. **Blog post**: Public version of findings
5. **Presentation**: 10-minute talk slides

## Getting Approval

Before starting, write a 1-page proposal:
- What will you build/study?
- Why does it matter?
- What's the expected outcome?
- What's the timeline?
- What could go wrong?

## Examples of Strong Capstones

- "I replicated the Constitutional AI harmlessness finding on a small model"
- "I contributed the new feature X to vLLM, now used by Y users"
- "I discovered that attention heads in layer 5 specialize in..."
- "I built an agent that can X with 90% accuracy on my eval suite"

## Quiz Usage

In quizzes, you'll likely be asked:
- "Tell me about a project you're proud of"
- "What's the most technically challenging thing you've built?"
- "Describe a research project you've done"

Your capstone should be a great answer to all of these.
